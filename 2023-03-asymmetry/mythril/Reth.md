# Analysis results for SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol

## Multiple Calls in a Single Transaction
- SWC ID: 113
- Severity: Low
- Contract: Reth
- Function name: `balance()`
- PC address: 1671
- Estimated Gas Usage: 3509 - 73858

### Description

Multiple calls are executed in the same transaction.
This call is executed following another call within the same transaction. It is possible that the call never gets executed if a prior call fails permanently. This might be caused intentionally by a malicious callee. If possible, refactor the code such that each transaction only executes one external call or make sure that all callees can be trusted (i.e. theyâ€™re part of your own codebase).
